      question: "How do you maintain independence?",
      answer: "We are completely independent. We don't accept paid placements, affiliate commissions, or any form of pay-to-rank. All vendors are evaluated using the same transparent criteria based on publicly available information.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are categories transparent?",
      answer: "Yes. Our categories are clearly defined and organized logically. Each vendor is placed in categories based on their actual products and capabilities, not marketing positioning.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do vendors pay to be listed?",
      answer: "No. There is no pay-to-rank system. Vendors cannot pay for better placement or visibility. All listings are based on objective information and user needs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I submit my company to be listed?",
      answer: "Yes! We welcome submissions from automation vendors. Use the 'Submit Your Company' button to send us your details. We'll review and add qualifying vendors to our directory—free of charge.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure accuracy?",
      answer: "We verify all information through public sources, vendor websites, and documentation. Our independent research ensures you get factual, unbiased information to make informed decisions.",
