// TODO: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) - This page is rendered on-demand at request time
// This page uses SSR instead of SSG because:
// 1. Complex pagination with dynamic query parameters (?page=2, etc.)
// 2. Dynamic filtering by category, technology, country, and search terms
// 3. Real-time vendor data that may change frequently
// 4. Search functionality requires server-side processing
// See STATIC_GENERATION_STRATEGY.md for details
